# Elk Ecosystem

ElkNet is built to create a cross-chain future for those building on it. In order for the whole cross-chain story to unfurl in an economically sustainable way, each element is required.

{% hint style="info" %}
* **ElkNet** is the foundation of Elk. It enables cross-chain interoperability.
* **ELK** is the mortar of Elk. A token that binds Elk together.
* **Moose** is a building block for Elk. To build on the foundation you need Moose.
{% endhint %}

Furthermore:

{% hint style="info" %}
* Nodes decentralize the ElkNet, and are secured by staking ELK.
* Paranodes allow the ElkNet to receive information from external sources - Moose staking power paranodes.
{% endhint %}

### ELK Use

There are many functions available on the ElkNet, as the foundation. The ELK token functions as the currency for the ecosystem and is required throughout the technology stack (ElkNet, Farm-as-a-Service, FaaS; Bridge-as-a-Service, BaaS) to enable developers and users to create, interact with and secure cross-chain operations for their projects.

Examples of ELK in use:

* ElkNet transfers for the current bridge we have built have a fee paid in ELK
* FaaS farms creation charge a fee paid in ELK
* BaaS bridge deployment fees are paid in ELK
* Moose rental fees to open bridges using BaaS is paid in ELK
* BaaS bridges can have custom fees/currencies. All cross-chain ElkNet services are paid in ELK
* ElkNet nodes that secure the decentralized network require staked ELK (\~100,000 ELK, initially)
* ElkDAO governance voting is available to ELK holders

### Moose Use

* Each Moose unlocks one side of a BaaS bridge on one chain.
* The Moose must be staked to provide that functionality, but it acts as a permissionless "license key" to build your own bridge.
* No Moose? Easy:
  * Rent a temporary Moose from Elk.
  * Buy a Moose from an NFT marketplace
  * Negogiate staking on your behalf with a Moose holder for profit-sharing
