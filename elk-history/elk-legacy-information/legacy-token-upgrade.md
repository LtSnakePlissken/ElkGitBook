# Legacy Token Upgrade

Starting April 9, 2022, all ELK token holders can upgrade their existing ELK tokens (which will become oELK, standing for "old ELK") to the new ELK token at a 1:1 ratio. (**Note**: ElkNet v1 will continue to accept cross-chain transfers of oELK until April 24).&#x20;

### Tutorial - How to Upgrade your $ELK Tokens:

{% hint style="info" %}
To exit old farms & break the LP for upgrading your oELK tokens, please do that in the [legacy.elk.finance](https://legacy.elk.finance/).&#x20;

**Old farms will not appear in app.elk.finance after the upgrade!** &#x20;
{% endhint %}

**1.** Go to app.elk.finance after the 9th of April, navigate to the **Upgrade $ELK** tab on top of the left hand menu, and click **Approve Upgrade** to authorize the upgrade**.**

After the 9th of April, the old $ELK token logo will turn purple and will be called oELK &#x20;
{% endhint %}

**2.** After approving the upgrade, you can upgrade $oELK 1:1 for the new $ELK. When you upgrade for the first time, you will be asked to respond to a series of questions, which are part of Elk's first governance vote.&#x20;

Remember to remove $ELK from existing LP tokens and single-sided pools. You can upgrade multiple times as needed.&#x20;
