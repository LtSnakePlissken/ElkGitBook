# Elk Finance

Elk Finance is building a peer-to-peer network for cross-chain value transfers and blockchain interoperability. ElkNet, the powerful cross-chain engine at the heart of the network, allows for secure and efficient transfers of value and information. This foundational element of our ecosystem reduces friction and asset fragmentation between blockchains.

The ElkNet is specifically designed for permissionless building by developers and projects. Get in touch and build on ElkNet today - create your own cross-chain solutions, trustlessly, safe and sound.

Community projects and developers will be able to build dynamic multi-chain applications that leverage ElkNet with features such as proxy tokens and cross-chain messaging.

Elk is thereby an infrastructure project bringing decentralized and permissionless cross-chain and liquidity oprations through the following innovative features:

* Cross-chain utility token for value transfer - ELK
* Safe and secure transfers compared to traditional bridges
* Bridging-as-a-Service (BaaS) for developers to use the ElkNet for custom bridging solutions
* Non-Fungible Tokens (Moose NFTs) with unique cross-chain purpose
* Cross-chain value transfer via ElkNet in seconds between all the blockchains Elk supports

and more on the way. Such as...

* Cross-chain swaps between all connected blockchains
* Cross-chain over-collateralized stablecoin
