## Setting up **Brave**&#x20;

[Brave](https://brave.com/) takes a different approach to their wallet app. It is not an extension of the browser, it is actually built right into the browser. This makes it more secure and it also uses fewer resources since it is built in.

In order to use the Brave Wallet, you have to download and be using the Brave Browser ([https://brave.com/download/](https://brave.com/download/)).\
\
**Quick Steps (For the more experienced, see below for detailed steps)**

1. [Download](https://brave.com/download/) or open Brave browser.
2. Install the wallet (which can be found in the toolbar of the Brave browser).&#x20;
3. After installation, create a password.
4. Back up your seed phrase.

**Setting Up Brave Wallet**

**1.** Go to the official Brave website here: [https://brave.com/wallet/](https://brave.com/wallet/). Make sure you use ONLY this link. Any others are a scam.
