2\. Click “Install MetaMask” for Android, iPhone, or the relevant browser if using a desktop (recommended), and install the app or browser extension (desktop).



3\. Open the app (or the browser you installed the MetaMask extension on desktop) and click “Get Started”, choose whether to import and existing wallet or create a new one, and choose whether to share data with MetaMask.

4\. Create a secure password that you will remember. This password will only be used on this device. Remember, if someone has your seed phrase, they can access your wallet even without the password!

5\. If creating a new wallet, write down your seed phrase and put it somewhere safe where it will not be seen by anyone but you. Never share this seed phrase with anyone, ever. Complete the backup task.
